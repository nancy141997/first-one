<font size="6"><u>Introduction to C++</u></font><br/>
<font size="5">C++, as we all know is an extension to C language and was developed by Bjarne stroustrup at bell labs. C++ is an intermediate level language, as it comprises a confirmation of both high level and low level language features. C++ is a statically typed, free form, multiparadigm, compiled general-purpose language.<br/>

C++ is an Object Oriented Programming language but is not purely Object Oriented. Its features like Friend and Virtual, violate some of the very important OOPS features, rendering this language unworthy of being called completely Object Oriented. Its a middle level language.</font><br/>

<p><font size="6"><u>Benefits of C++ over C Language</u></font><br/>
<font size="5">The major difference being OOPS concept, C++ is an object oriented language whereas C language is a procedural language. Apart form this there are many other features of C++ which gives this language an upper hand on C laguage.<br/>

Following features of C++ makes it a stronger language than C,<br/>

There is Stronger Type Checking in C++.<br/>
All the OOPS features in C++ like Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance etc makes it more worthy and useful for programmers.<br/>
C++ supports and allows user defined operators (i.e Operator Overloading) and function overloading is also supported in it.<br/>
Exception Handling is there in C++.<br/>
The Concept of Virtual functions and also Constructors and Destructors for Objects.<br/>
Inline Functions in C++ instead of Macros in C language. Inline functions make complete function body act like Macro, safely.<br/>
Variables can be declared anywhere in the program in C++, but must be declared before they are used.</font>
